# Welcome to Developing ASP.NET Web API Applications ðŸš€

This course is the last piece of the back-end puzzle. It covers how to build independent back-end solutions that can be used by any interface such as websites, phones, smart devices, other services, and more. We can do this by building our web API that services requests from any device that can make them. This is all done through the ASP.NET framework and is a completely independent back-end application that does not have a dedicated front-end application packaged with it. We will also discover other frameworks that are used for managing data as well as the topic of testing, security, and logging. All of this will be done through coding sessions and workshops to prepare for coding. Hope you have fun and good luck ðŸ˜‰
